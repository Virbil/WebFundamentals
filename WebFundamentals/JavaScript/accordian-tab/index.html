    <h1>World's Best Coffee Roasters</h1>
    <div id="accordion">
        <h3>The Barn</h3>
        <div>
            <p>The Barn’s MO is fairly simple: source, roast and brew stupidly good coffee.</p>

                </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Coffee Supreme</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Coffee Supreme is decades ahead of most roasters in the coffee world. Its been 
                roasting beans since the ’90s, and it sources those beans from virtually every 
                specialty region and sub-region out there.

        <h3>Seesaw Coffee</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                ust about every industry that makes things to be sold has, at some point, 
                considered the idea of breaking into China and its unfathomably large 
                potential. Coffee is no different. Rumblings from in-the-know coffee people 
                like James Hoffmann and green-coffee buyers from all over have been talking 
                about it for a while now, but the great Chinese coffee boom may finally be happening.

        </div>
        <h3>Switch Coffee</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Switch Coffee is an unlikely addition to the list. It’s not a large-scale roaster, 
                it operates out of a single café with a single Probat roaster and is headed by a 
                single person. But Masahiro Onishi’s shop size belies its goodness.

        <div id="tabs-1">
            <p>South Korea went from a country drinking primarily instant coffee to one craving the 
                best specialty coffee there is in just a few years. Put another way, the number of 
                cafés in South Korea has grown nearly three times over in the last five years alone. 
                This makes it one of, if not the, fastest emerging market in specialty coffee and coffee 
                at large.

        <div id="tabs-2">
            <p>Spain is and has been drenched in coffee for some time, just not much of it very good. 
                Joaquín Parra’s Spanish coffee roasting instituion is named for the side of the brain 
                that dictates “creativity and passion,” and Right Side Coffee’s beans exude that.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tabs-3">
            <p>If there were a Michael Jordan of the coffee world, it would be Rubens Gardelli. By 
                accolades, he’s the most successful competition roaster ever. He’s qualified for the 
                most World Coffee Roasting Championships (four of five times), won the most recent one, 
                won the Italian Coffee Roasting Championship four years running and somehow has also won 
                multiple Brewer’s Cups in Italy and a World Brewer’s Cup. No roaster comes close to 
                these achievements.
